## Install

```shell
npm i sypent
```

## Why sypent?

sypent is awesome because it's simple and so useful.

It's also very lightweight. Like &lt;0.5K unminified lightweight.

## Usage

Let's create a `div` with class 'message' with a text node child.

```js
let addDiv = sy('div', {'class': 'message'}, ['This is a text node.'])
```

Now let's create a `p` tag with text nested inside of a div.

```js
let complex = sy('div', {}, [
	sy('p', {}, ['Hey there.'])
])
```

## In detail

sy(String `tagName`, ?Object `attributes`, ?Array[HTMLElement | String | DocumentFragment] `children`)

`tagName` - Tag of generated element.

*optional* `attributes` - Attributes for generated element. Default: `{}`

*optional* `children` - Children (elements) of generated element. May also contain strings, which will be made into text nodes. Default: `[]`
